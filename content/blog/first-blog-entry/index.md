Hello all! It’s me, it’s Dave. I am here to update you on my journey as I crusade through the tech world. I will try to keep you in the loop with the latest topics. All failing, it will be at least a FUN read.

Today:

I checked out the rise of the React! Totally interested, totally ready, let’s go. A new framework with tons of fancy features and ways to revolutionize the tech world, as all new toys say they will. I will start my coding journey with this today and keep you posted on my progress.

Can you tell I’m hungry to get PAID…err, I mean learn. No! Really I do want to learn, I am hungry for it and loving my new found ability to read and write my own code! What a liberating experience! I am currently on a 2 hour binge per day to keep my fingers on fire.

To stay in the loop I’ve started watching the tech news from tech crunch:
[**Crunch Report**
*Crunch Report - Your daily roundup of the biggest TechCrunch stories and startup news.*techcrunch.com](https://techcrunch.com/video/crunchreport/)

Fantastic series of episodes, regularly broadcasting fantastic content with a bit/a lot of hilarity to keep you interested in any of the slightly more technical info!

This guy, this guy…his faces.

Anyway coders! I’m off to finalise some cv work.

### Au revoir pour le moment…
